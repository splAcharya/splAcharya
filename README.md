I love coding, be it software or hardware. I am currently pursuing masterâ€™s degree in computer science. I also have a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering. Outside of college, I do certifications and projects in Machine Learning. My eventual goal is to focus on Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

Currently I work at Eden Medical, Inc as an embedded computer vision intern, where I am developing containerized systems for medical image (diabetic foot ulcers) analysis which is deployed on edge device (jetson nano). This includes use of tools such as ImageJ, open-cv (for image processing) and tensorflow-Keras (for semantic segmentation and landmark detection).

As part of my masterâ€™s degree, I am currently researching on Automated text summarization using natural language processing techniques and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

As of right now my primary programming language is Python. However, I am proficient in C/C++ as well.

I am also quite familiar with embedded systems as well. As part of my undergraduate computer engineering program, I have developed systems that use Microcontrollers (ARM assembly and C/C++), FPGA(Verilog) and SOC (C/C++ and Verilog HDL). Most of my embedded systems projects focused on developing digital signal processing applications.
