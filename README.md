I love programming , be it software or hardware. I am currently pursuing Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science.

In my graduate school coursework, I enjoyed distributed systems programming the most. Outside of college and work, I am doing certifications and projects to learn how Machine Learning can be used to solve problems in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing areas.

As part of my masterâ€™s degree, I am currently researching Automated text summarization using natural language processing techniques and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

Currently I work at Eden Medical, Inc as an embedded software engineer for computer vision applications, where I am developing containerized systems for medical image (diabetic foot ulcers) analysis which is deployed on edge device (jetson nano). This includes use of tools such as ImageJ, open-cv (for image processing) and tensorflow-Keras (for object-detection, landmark detection and semantic segmentation).

I am also quite familiar with embedded systems as well. As part of my undergraduate computer engineering program, I have developed several systems that use Microcontrollers, FPGA(Verilog) and SOC. Most of my embedded systems projects focused on developing digital signal processing applications.
